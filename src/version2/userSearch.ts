  /**
   * Finds users with a structured query and returns a
   * [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/#pagination) list of user keys.
   *
   * This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and
   * then returns only the users from that range that match the structured query. This means the operation usually
   * returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get
   * all users](#api-rest-api-2-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
   *
   * **[Permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/#permissions) required:** _Browse
   * users and groups_ [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
   *
   * The query statements are:
   *
   * - `is assignee of PROJ` Returns the users that are assignees of at least one issue in project _PROJ_.
   * - `is assignee of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are assignees on the issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `is reporter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are reporters on the issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `is watcher of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are watchers on the issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `is voter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are voters on the issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `is commenter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have posted a comment on the issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `is transitioner of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have performed a transition on issues _PROJ-1_ or _PROJ-2_.
   * - `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value.
   *
   * The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in _(PROJ-1, PROJ-2, ... PROJ-n)_. Statements can be combined
   * using the `AND` and `OR` operators to form more complex queries. For example:
   *
   * `is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"`
