  /**
   * Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.
   *
   * This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible
   * way. Consult the [Jira expressions
   * documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/) for more details.
   *
   * #### Context variables
   *
   * The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence
   * depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload,
   * but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.
   *
   * - `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The
   *   current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
   * - `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The
   *   [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request.
   *   Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect
   *   apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
   * - `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The
   *   current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
   * - `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of
   *   [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A
   *   collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
   * - `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)):
   *   The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
   * - `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)):
   *   The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
   * - `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The
   *   current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
   * - `serviceDesk`
   *   ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)):
   *   The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
   * - `customerRequest`
   *   ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)):
   *   The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context
   *   object.
   *
   * Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by
   * key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:
   *
   * - `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)
   *   specified as an Atlassian account ID.
   * - `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)
   *   specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
   * - `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
   * - `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.
   *
   * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
   *
   * **[Permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/intro/#permissions) required**: None.
   * However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For
   * example, different users may see different comments on the same issue. Permission to access Jira Software is
   * required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).
