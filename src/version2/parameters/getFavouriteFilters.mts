   *
   * - `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that
   *   the filter is shared with. If you don't specify `sharedUsers`, then the `sharedUsers` object is returned but it
   *   doesn't list any users. The list of users returned is limited to 1000, to access additional users append
   *   `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request. For example, to access the next 1000 users, use
   *   `?expand=sharedUsers[1001:2000]`.
   * - `subscriptions` Returns the users that are subscribed to the filter. If you don't specify `subscriptions`, the
   *   `subscriptions` object is returned but it doesn't list any subscriptions. The list of subscriptions returned is
   *   limited to 1000, to access additional subscriptions append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request. For
   *   example, to access the next 1000 subscriptions, use `?expand=subscriptions[1001:2000]`.
