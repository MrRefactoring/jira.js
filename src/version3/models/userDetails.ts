 * User details permitted by the user's Atlassian Account privacy settings. However, be aware of these exceptions:*
 *
 * - User record deleted from Atlassian: This occurs as the result of a right to be forgotten request. In this case,
 *   `displayName` provides an indication and other parameters have default values or are blank (for example, email is
 *   blank).
 * - User record corrupted: This occurs as a results of events such as a server import and can only happen to deleted
 *   users. In this case, `accountId` returns _unknown_ and all other parameters have fallback values.
 * - User record unavailable: This usually occurs due to an internal service outage. In this case, all parameters have
 *   fallback values.
