     * - `editmeta` Returns information about how each field can be edited.
     * - `changelog` Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.
     * - `versionedRepresentations` Instead of `fields`, returns `versionedRepresentations` a JSON array containing each
     *   version of a field's value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version.
