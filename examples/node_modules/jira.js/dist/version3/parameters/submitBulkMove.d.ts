     * The key is a string that is created by concatenating the following three entities in order, separated by commas.
     * The format is `<project ID or key>,<issueType ID>,<parent ID or key>`. It should be unique across mappings provided
     * in the payload. If you provide multiple mappings for the same key, only one will be processed. However, the
     * operation won't fail, so the error may be hard to track down.

     * _**Destination project**_ (Required): ID or key of the project to which the issues are being moved. _**Destination
     * issueType**_ (Required): ID of the issueType to which the issues are being moved. _**Destination parent ID or
     * key**_ (Optional): ID or key of the issue which will become the parent of the issues being moved. Only required
     * when the destination issueType is a subtask.
